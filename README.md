### Week 4: HTML + CSS

### Weeks 5-7: JavaScript

#### Week 5: Fundamentals + DOM Interaction

For week 5, we'll cover the fundamentals of python: variables, comparisons, conditionals, loops. All these have direct analogues to Python, so learning the syntax should be easy. Then we'll move onto [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) interaction, which will enable us to change the attributes, style, and content of HTML elements.


#### Week 6: Vue

#### Week 7: Ajax

### Weeks 8-11: Django
